## Projects

### [009 Orders and Items](009-Orders_and_Items/)

The **Orders and Items** project is a Java-based application designed to manage orders and items in a café setting. It consists of two main classes: `Item` and `Order`. The `Item` class represents individual menu items, each with a name and price. Additionally, it includes a method to display the café menu, listing the available items along with their respective prices. On the other hand, the `Order` class manages customer orders, storing information such as the customer's name, the total price of the order, and whether the order is ready for pickup. The application allows users to create orders, add items to them, calculate the total cost of an order, and mark orders as ready for pickup. Sample terminal executions demonstrate the functionality of placing orders, updating order statuses, and displaying receipts. This project serves as a practical exercise in object-oriented programming, demonstrating concepts such as class composition, ArrayList usage, and method implementation.

### [010 Barista's Challenge](010-Baristas_Challenge/)

The **Barista's Challenge** project is a Java application designed to simulate an ordering system for a cafe. It allows users to create orders, add items to their orders, and view receipts for their orders. The project includes classes for `Item` and `Order`, where `Item` represents menu items with their respective prices, and `Order` represents individual orders placed by customers. The main functionality includes adding items to orders, calculating the total price of an order, and displaying a receipt with detailed information about the order. Error handling is implemented to handle scenarios where an order has no items. The project serves as a practical exercise in object-oriented programming and demonstrates the use of ArrayLists in Java.
