## Projects

### [001 First Java Program](001-First_Java/)
A simple Java program named `FirstJava` designed to illustrate basic console output. The program introduces variables such as `myName`, `myAge`, `hometown`, and `state` to store information about a person. Utilizing `System.out.println` and `System.out.printf`, it prints details like the person's name, age, hometown, and state to the console. The code is structured to showcase concatenation and formatted output, providing a straightforward example for those learning Java.

### [002 Café Java](002-Cafe_Java/)
The **Café Java** project is a Java program simulating a café ordering system. Customers place coffee orders, and the program responds with messages based on the order status, indicating whether the order is ready or pending. It calculates and displays the total cost for each order, considering different coffee items and quantities. The simulation involves four customers, each with specific orders, providing a dynamic scenario for testing the program's logic. Additionally, the project showcases the use of variables, conditional statements, and formatted messages to create a realistic interaction between customers and a virtual barista.
