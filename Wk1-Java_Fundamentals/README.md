## Projects

### [001 First Java Program](001-First_Java/)
A simple Java program named **FirstJava** designed to illustrate basic console output. The program introduces variables such as `myName`, `myAge`, `hometown`, and `state` to store information about a person. Utilizing `System.out.println` and `System.out.printf`, it prints details like the person's name, age, hometown, and state to the console. The code is structured to showcase concatenation and formatted output, providing a straightforward example for those learning Java.

### [002 Café Java](002-Cafe_Java/)
The **Café Java** project is a Java program simulating a café ordering system. Customers place coffee orders, and the program responds with messages based on the order status, indicating whether the order is ready or pending. It calculates and displays the total cost for each order, considering different coffee items and quantities. The simulation involves four customers, each with specific orders, providing a dynamic scenario for testing the program's logic. Additionally, the project showcases the use of variables, conditional statements, and formatted messages to create a realistic interaction between customers and a virtual barista.

### [003 Alfred Bot](003-Alfred_Bot/)
The **AlfredBot** Java project is a virtual assistant simulation designed to interact through various greetings and conversations. It features modularization with a main class file (`AlfredQuotes`) encapsulating greeting-related functionalities and a test file (`AlfredTest`) for method verification. The project includes guest greetings, date announcements with regular and simplified formats, and conversation responses based on mentions of "Alexis" or "Alfred." Utilizing Java's standard libraries for date handling, the project emphasizes modularity, readability, and efficient organization. The `AlfredTest` file serves as an interactive testing ground, allowing users to simulate different interactions with Alfred.


### [004 Café Business Logic](004-Cafe_Business_Logic/)
The **Café Business Logic** project comprises a set of Java classes designed to facilitate various operations within a café environment. It includes functionalities such as calculating rewards for loyal customers based on a specified duration, summing up the total cost of orders, displaying menus with and without prices, generating price charts for products based on quantity discounts, and managing customer waitlists. These functionalities are encapsulated within the `CafeUtil` class and are invoked and tested through the `TestCafe` class. With its modular and user-friendly design, Café Business Logic provides essential tools for café owners and managers to streamline operations, enhance customer experiences, and optimize business processes.


### [005 Puzzling](005-Puzzling/)
The **PuzzleJava** project is designed to assess problem-solving skills and familiarity with the language by presenting various challenges related to client-side operations. The project introduces the usage of the Random class to generate random values and includes methods to tackle specific tasks such as generating random numbers, letters, and passwords of varying lengths. Additionally, it provides functionality to shuffle arrays in a pseudorandom manner, crucial for ensuring the randomness and security of generated passwords.

### [006 Map of Hashmatique](006-Map_of_Hashmatique/)
**Map of Hashmatique** project is designed to organize a band's song list using a **`HashMap`**. It allows for immediate retrieval of song lyrics based on the song name, enables users to add songs to the list, and provides functionality to print out all tracks with their corresponding lyrics. The project encapsulates this functionality within the `Hashmatique` class, providing a simple and efficient way to manage and display a band's song repertoire.

### [007 List of Exceptions](007-List_of_Exceptions/)
The "A List of Exceptions" project showcases the use of try-catch blocks in Java to handle type casting exceptions within an ArrayList containing heterogeneous data types. By iterating through the list and attempting to assign each item to an integer variable, the code demonstrates how exceptions, particularly `ClassCastException`, can be gracefully caught and handled. This approach ensures that the program continues execution even when encountering errors, thereby enhancing its robustness and reliability.
<!-- Through effective error management and debugging assistance provided by the try-catch blocks, the project exemplifies a professional and resilient approach to handling exceptions in Java programming. -->
